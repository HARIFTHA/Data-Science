Skill-Based Clustering of FIFA 20 Players using Unsupervised Learning

To cluster professional football players based on their on-field skill attributes and roles (e.g., striker, winger, midfielder) using unsupervised learning algorithms. 
The goal is to group players with similar skill sets to support scouting, wage analysis, and role-based performance understanding.

Clustering Approaches:
KMeans, KMeans++, DBSCAN (density-based clustering)

DBSCAN produced the most coherent and dense clusters by identifying meaningful player groupings without requiring a fixed number of clusters.

Tools & Libraries
1. Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
2. Sweetviz
3. Unsupervised ML: KMeans, DBSCAN
4. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
5. Evaluation: Silhouette Score, EDA Visualizations
