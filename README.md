Heart Disease Prediction :

A machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical parameters using the HeartDiseasePred dataset.
Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection allows for effective treatment or lifestyle changes to reduce risks. 
This project builds various ML models to classify whether a person is likely to develop heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Models Trained
Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, Neural Network (MLP)

Best Model
The Neural Network outperformed other models with an accuracy of 88%, as well as the highest ROC-AUC, indicating superior ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
Boosting techniques like XGBoost also demonstrated strong performance, confirming that ensemble methods enhance predictive power.
