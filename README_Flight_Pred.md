FlightPricePrediction

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. 
We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpre dictable. 
Thatâ€™s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain.

Models trained:
AdaBoost, CatBoost, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, Linear Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost           

Best Model:
XGBoost and CatBoost show the best balance between high accuracy and generalization.
